The responses from the lab participants w.r.t the question "is the Constable app was useful and would you use it?" gave very different results as shown above. As the stats show 48% of the participants absolutely found the app useful and interesting, while 12% gave it a 4/5 rating and 29% rated it 3/5. A small percentage of 9.7% showed a disinterest in using the app and did not find it useful therefore rating it low value. The reason some of the participants did not find it useful were is because it lacked a few features which they were looking for in the app.

## Suggesstions for Lab Participants

- Item 1 "The app would be better if it checks inside individual files to and then rate them. "

- Item 2 "Include issues (closed and open), commits (are descriptive), number of contributors and documentation as a factor too."

- Item 3 "Considering the content and usability of README.md and code coverage "

- Item 4 "Weighted Scoring of each metric considered"
- Item 5 "I'd like to see it tracking the code coverage and if code build passes or not. Also, currently I can use the application on my repositories only. I'd like to see Constable working on other public repositories as well. "
